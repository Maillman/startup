## Git Notes
Resolving conflicts is pretty hard. I would recommend trying to avoid doing such things. Always pull first, make the changes and push. I'd honestly would rather resolve the conflicts on GitHub and not on VS Code.
Github Copilot is extremely powerful, make sure to renew my Github Student Education plan to maintain access to that feature.
## AWS Notes
Honestly, it's a good thing I was practically walked the whole way through as it was very easy to get lost. So I'm pretty thankful for the instructions on setting up an EC2 instance and create an elastic IP address.

My elastic IP address is 34.200.36.24

To SSH into my EC2 instance from the CS260 folder in Git Bash, use this command:

ssh -i inclass.pem ubuntu@34.200.36.24
## HTML Notes
**HTML Structure:** Don't forget that you not only have to open a tag, but close the tag as well or else things will start looking a little wierd and it will be very frustrating trying to figure out what was wrong. Perhaps I will also learn more with time.
Also, I really like how you can take an image from anywhere and if linked will show up on your HTML page.

**HTML Input:** The color type seems to act a little weird whenever you mess with it on the HTML page and also try to edit it in HTML. Looking at the GitHub page and even [it's associated link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) is also extremely useful when trying to figure out implementing input into an html page. Especially when trying to deal with regex and patterns like emails and whatnot!
## Startup Notes
You can now reach my startup using https://melvinwhitaker.com instead of the elastic IP address.
Caddy is really useful in generating certificates to give to the user.
I also realize how important it is to have Vim, especially when SSH'ing into my server.
