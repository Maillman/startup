## Git Notes
Resolving conflicts is pretty hard. I would recommend trying to avoid doing such things. Always pull first, make the changes and push. I'd honestly would rather resolve the conflicts on GitHub and not on VS Code.
## AWS Notes
Honestly, it's a good thing I was practically walked the whole way through as it was very easy to get lost. So I'm pretty thankful for the instructions on setting up an EC2 instance and create an elastic IP address.

My elastic IP address is 34.200.36.24

To SSH into my EC2 instance from the CS260 folder in Git Bash, use this command:

ssh -i inclass.pem ubuntu@34.200.36.24
